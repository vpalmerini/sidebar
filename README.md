# SideBar

This project is an example of a responsive _SideBar_ component built with [React](https://reactjs.org/).

In this [post](https://vpalmerini.github.io/blog/sidebar-com-react/) (only _pt-br_ for now), you can follow a walkthrough to built the component from scratch using only [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

If you find any bug or have a suggestion, you are very welcome to open an issue in this repository.
